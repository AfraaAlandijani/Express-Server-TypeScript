# Express JavaScript Server

This repository contains a basic Express.js server application with various features. The server application allows you to handle different HTTP requests and perform specific actions:

1. Set up a server that listens on a specified port (e.g., port 8080).
2. Create a route to handle GET requests to the root URL ("/") and send a "Hello, World!" response.
3. Implement a route to handle POST requests to the root URL ("/") and log the received data to the console.
4. Create a route to handle GET requests to "/products" and send a response with information accordingly.
5. Implement a route to handle POST requests to "/products" and save the received data to a file on the server.
6. Implement a route to handle PUT & DELETE requests to "/products"
